# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-DL

The detection of a brain tumor at an early stage is a key issue for providing improved treatment. Once a brain tumor is clinically suspected, radiological evaluation is required to determine its location, its size, and impact on the surrounding areas. On the basis of this information the best therapy, surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy, is decided. It is evident that the chances of survival of a tumor-infected patient can be increased significantly if the tumor is detected accurately in its early stage .
Deep neural networks are now the state-of-the-art machine learning models across a variety of areas, from image analysis to natural language processing, and widely deployed in academia and industry. These developments have a huge potential for medical imaging technology, medical data analysis, medical diagnostics and healthcare in general, slowly being realized.
